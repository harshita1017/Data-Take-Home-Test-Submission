# 📌 Linq Data Engineering Take-Home Test

## Problem Statement
Imagine you're working in an event-driven system where messages are constantly flowing through an event bus. A worker service processes these events in real time, but due to an error, **some events were either missed or processed incorrectly**.

Since we **don’t have a traditional database** to store historical event data, we need a way to **recalculate and recover the correct state** efficiently.

---

## ✅ Solution Approach
Given the lack of a database, our approach needs to:
- Reprocess or reconstruct missing/corrupt events.
- Ensure accuracy and consistency while replaying events.
- Scale efficiently to handle **millions of events per hour**.
- Minimize storage dependency.

### 🔍 **Step 1: Identifying Missing or Incorrect Events**
To detect events that need reprocessing, we can use:
- **Event logs (if available):** Checking system logs or error reports for anomalies.
- **Gaps in event sequences:** Analyzing timestamps to spot missing events.
- **Downstream inconsistencies:** If aggregate metrics don’t add up, it’s a sign something is off.
- **ML-based detection:** Using a model to flag unusual patterns in event data.
- **Status checks:** If an event isn’t marked as `processed`, we assume it needs to be replayed.

### 🔄 **Step 2: Replaying and Recomputing Events**
Depending on the setup, we can use different recovery strategies:

#### ✅ **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) or Retry-Based Reprocessing**
- Instead of relying on rewinding Kafka topics, the preferred method is using a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) or Retry Topic**.
- Events that fail processing are moved to a **retry queue** for reprocessing.
- If an event continues to fail after multiple attempts, it is sent to the **DLQ for manual inspection and debugging**.
- **Solution:**
  - Process incoming events.
  - If an event fails, push it to a **retry queue** (with exponential backoff to prevent system overload).
  - If it fails **after N retries**, move it to the **DLQ** for further debugging or manual intervention.

#### ✅ **State Reconstruction from Derived Data**
- If past event logs are unavailable, we infer missing states using aggregated results.
- Example: If a financial system only stores total balances but not individual transactions, we estimate missing transactions based on snapshots.

#### ✅ **In-Memory Processing for Quick Recovery**
- For smaller datasets, **in-memory caching (e.g., Redis)** can temporarily hold and replay events.

---

## 🚦 Error Handling & Ensuring Consistency
To keep things running smoothly:
- **Retries:** Events are retried via a **retry queue** with exponential backoff.
- **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ):** Events that fail after `N` retries are moved to the **DLQ** for investigation.
- **Scalability:**
  - **Kafka partitions** distribute event replay across multiple workers.
  - For large-scale recovery, **Apache Spark** could be used for batch reprocessing instead of real-time replay.

---

## 🛠️ **Implementation**
We assume a Kafka-based system and implement a Python script that:
- Reads events from Kafka.
- Pushes failed events to a **retry queue**.
- Uses retries and a **DLQ** to handle failures.

## ⚖️ **Trade-offs & Limitations**
### **Trade-offs**
- **Kafka Dependency:** This assumes access to Kafka. Alternative solutions might be needed for other messaging systems.
- **DLQ Manual Intervention:** Events in the DLQ require investigation, which may introduce delays in event recovery.

### 🛠️ How the Approach Would Change with More Tools  
Depending on the available infrastructure, additional tools can enhance the process of detecting and replaying missing events:

| **Tool**  | **How It Helps** |
|----------|---------------------------|
| **Database (SQL or NoSQL)** | If a traditional database were available, we could store a **historical record of events**, making it easier to query and reconstruct missing data. This would enable **point-in-time recovery**, allowing us to identify and replay only the missing events. Additionally, indexing event IDs and timestamps would improve lookup efficiency. |
| **Event Logs** | If structured logs of past events exist (e.g., application logs, audit logs), we could analyze them to identify patterns of missing or incorrectly processed messages. By scanning logs, we might also find **error messages or stack traces** related to failed events, helping diagnose the root cause. These logs could then be used to generate replayable events. |
| **Data Lake (S3, HDFS, BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.)** | A data lake could store raw event data **for long-term retention**, enabling batch reprocessing when needed. This would be useful for **historical backfill operations**, where we need to recover large amounts of lost or corrupted data beyond Kafka’s retention period. With tools like **Apache Spark or Presto**, we could efficiently analyze and extract missing event information. |

By leveraging these tools, we could enhance the robustness of our event replay system, reduce reliance on real-time Kafka retention, and provide a more **scalable and resilient** approach to event recovery. 🚀

## 📊 **Scalability Considerations**
For high-volume systems, we can optimize performance by:
- **Using Kafka partitions** to distribute event reprocessing across multiple workers.
- **Batch reprocessing** with **Apache Spark**, rather than handling events one by one.
- **Using Redis or RocksDB** for state recovery instead of depending on Kafka’s retention period.

---

## 🎯 **Final Thoughts**
This approach provides a **scalable and efficient** way to recover from missing or incorrect events in an event-driven system. By leveraging **retry queues and DLQs**, we ensure **fault tolerance, error handling, and debugging support** without depending on database storage. 🚀
